<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>300g undyed smoked haddock fillet, skin on</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>300ml milk</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>Handful chopped parsley</li>
    <li>Handful chopped coriander</li>
    <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
    <li>2 tsp curry powder</li>
    <li>300g easy-cook long grain rice, rinsed under running water</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        For the rice, heat 2 tbsp vegetable oil in a large, lidded pan, 
        add 1 finely chopped large onion, then gently fry for 5 mins until 
        softened but not coloured.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add 1 tsp ground coriander, 1 tsp ground turmeric and 2 tsp curry powder, 
        season with salt, then continue to fry until the mix starts to go brown and 
        fragrant; about 3 mins.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add 300g rinsed easy-cook long grain rice and stir in well. Add 600ml water, 
        stir, then bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer, then cover for 10 mins.
    </li>
    <li>
        Take off the heat and leave to stand, covered, for 10-15 mins more. The rice
         will be perfectly cooked if you do not lift the lid before the end of the cooking.
    </li>
    <li>
        Meanwhile, put 300g skin-on undyed smoked haddock fillet and 2 bay leaves in a 
        frying pan, cover with 300ml milk, then poach for 10 mins until the flesh flakes. 
        Remove from the milk, peel away the skin, then flake the flesh into thumb-sized 
        pieces.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place 4 eggs in a pan, cover with water, bring to the boil, then reduce to a 
        simmer. Leave for 4½-5 mins, plunge into cold water, then peel and cut the eggs 
        into quarters.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gently mix the fish, eggs, a handful each of chopped parsley and coriander, and 
        rice together in the pan. Serve hot, sprinkled with a few extra herbs.
    </li>
</ol>
